= Module 5: Conclusion

[#recap]
== 5.1 Recap of Business Value & Key Takeaways
This lab has demonstrated the power of RHEL Image Mode for building, deploying, and managing edge appliances. By treating the OS and applications as a single, versioned unit, you can:

* *Accelerate Time-to-Market:* Utilize DevOps/CI/CD practices for the entire system.
* *Simplify Appliance Creation:* Combine the OS, applications, and drivers into a single artifact.
* *Streamline Field Operations:* Benefit from smartphone-like reliability with atomic updates and rollbacks.
* *Enhance Security:* Reduce the attack surface and prevent configuration drift.
* *Enable Disconnected Deployments:* Ship self-contained appliances for air-gapped environments.
* *Manage Fleets at Scale:* Use standard container registries to manage OS and application versions.
