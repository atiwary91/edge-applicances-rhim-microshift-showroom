== Learning objectives
By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Understand the structure of a bootc Containerfile and how it extends a base RHEL image
* Explain why EUS (Extended Update Support) images are used for appliances
* Explain why `redhat.repo` (or equivalent) is embedded in the base image
* Explain physically-bound images and how container images are embedded immutably
* Understand why embedded images are placed under `/usr/lib` rather than `/var`
* Build a base RHEL image with MicroShift using Podman
* Build a self-contained appliance image with embedded applications
* Generate a bootable ISO from a container image using the bootc-image-builder

[#containerfile]
== 2.1 Anatomy of a bootc Appliance Containerfile
A `Containerfile` is the recipe for your appliance. It defines:

* The base OS (RHEL bootc base)
* MicroShift components and required RPMs
* System configuration, firewall, and hardening
* Embedded manifests (Quadlets) and application images
* Scripts or units to import embedded images at runtime

=== Why use EUS (Extended Update Support)?
We choose **EUS** images for appliances because they provide:
* Long lifecycle stability (fewer, predictable changes)
* A predictable minor release stream (helpful for validated appliances)
* A better platform match for long-running edge/industrial deployments

Appliances typically prefer stability and predictability over the fastest-moving release.

=== Why embed `redhat.repo` (or repo metadata) into the image?
`bootc-image-builder` and container-based builds use `dnf` within the image build. To ensure `dnf` can resolve packages during build, the base image must contain repo metadata (for example `/etc/yum.repos.d/redhat.repo`). Embedding the repo file inside the base ensures that:

* Builds are reproducible (the same repos used each time).
* `dnf` can perform package installs during the container build step.
* The image builder has the correct subscription/repo context.

This Containerfile extends the RHEL EUS bootc base image, installs MicroShift, configures firewall rules, applies CIS hardening, and places manifests for MicroShift.

You don’t need to edit `Containerfile.base` for this lab — we show it so you understand what’s being installed into the appliance.

[#physically_bound]
== 2.2 Creating “Physically-Bound” Images
A **physically-bound** image contains everything needed to run: the OS, MicroShift, application container images, and any Quadlets/manifests. This enables **true offline operation**.

Benefits:
* Boot and run applications without any internet access
* MicroShift can start and immediately use local images
* Deterministic appliances that match exactly what you validated

=== The immutability reason: `/usr` vs `/var`
Under Image Mode the root filesystem is treated as read-only at runtime. Key points:

* `/usr` — written during the build process, becomes part of the image and is versioned with the OS.
* `/var` — runtime data store; mutable and not intended to be the place for versioned, build-time assets.

Storing embedded images under `/usr/lib/...` makes them part of the immutable image and ensures:
* Images are versioned together with the OS image
* They are upgrade-safe and roll back with the OS
* They cannot be accidentally mutated at runtime

If we stored them in `/var`, they would not be tied to the OS image lifecycle and could drift.

=== How physical embedding works (concept + commands)
We embed images using `skopeo` and the `dir:` transport during the **build**.

*Embed into a directory inside the image (build time):*

[source,bash]
----
RUN skopeo copy --preserve-digests docker://registry.example.com/my-app:1.0 \
    dir:/usr/lib/containers-image-cache/my-app-1.0
----

This creates a directory that contains the image content and preserves digests so references by SHA still work.

*At runtime (first boot or ExecStartPre), import into Podman’s mutable store:*

[source,bash]
----
/usr/bin/skopeo copy --preserve-digests \
    dir:/usr/lib/containers-image-cache/my-app-1.0 \
    containers-storage:registry.example.com/my-app@sha256:<digest>
----

This loads the embedded data into the Podman storage so MicroShift (or kubelet/container runtimes) can reference the image by name or digest.

=== Why `dir:` transport?
* `dir:` allows bundling multiple images under one directory.
* It preserves image digests (crucial for referencing by SHA).
* It’s file-system friendly and portable within the ISO.

=== Why not use a secondary image store?
A secondary store is not replaced during an OS upgrade. Embedded images *change with each OS image* and must live inside that OS image to be versioned and rolled back together. That’s why we place them under `/usr/lib`.

=== Helper scripts (what they do)
This repo includes two helper scripts you’ll see and can inspect:

* `embed_image.sh` — used during the Containerfile build to `skopeo copy` an image into the `/usr/lib/...` dir.  
  - Usage: `embed_image.sh <image-reference> [--all] [--authfile ...]`  
  - If referencing a manifest list by digest, use `--all` so `skopeo` copies the whole manifest list and ALL variant images.

* `copy_embedded_images.sh` — invoked at boot (via a systemd ExecStartPre) to copy all embedded `dir:` images into the Podman container store (containers-storage), making them available to MicroShift.

----

When the build completes, the ISO will appear under `_build/` or `/var/tmp/bootc-images/`.

== Validation checkpoint: Verify build success
Before proceeding, verify that both images were built successfully:

. Check that the base image exists:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
sudo podman images | grep microshift-4.19-bootc
----

. Verify the v1 appliance image exists:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
sudo podman images | grep microshift-4.19-bootc-embeeded
----

. Confirm the ISO file was created:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
ls -lh /var/tmp/bootc-images/bootiso/*.iso || ls -lh _build/*.iso
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
**Expected results:**

* Base image `localhost/microshift-4.19-bootc:latest` should be present
* Appliance image `localhost/microshift-4.19-bootc-embeeded:v1` should be present
* ISO file `microshift-4.19-bootc-embeeded-v1.iso` should exist in `/var/tmp/bootc-images/bootiso/` or `_build/`
* ISO file size will likely be several GB (it contains embedded container images)
====

== 2.4 What happens next
Once installed on the target VM:

* Embedded images are available *before* MicroShift starts
* The systemd ExecStartPre runs `copy_embedded_images.sh` to populate the container store
* MicroShift launches workloads immediately — no external registry needed

This pattern ensures predictable, repeatable, and offline-friendly deployments.
